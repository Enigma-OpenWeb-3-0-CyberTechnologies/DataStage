# DataStage Remote Engine

**Remote Engine** for DataStage on IBM Cloud allows you to setup an execution engine to run your workloads at a cloud location of your choice. Currently this technology is in a closed Beta.

The setup can be done locally on Linux or Mac machines as a Docker instance, or as a service on a Kubernetes cluster. See the README.md in the respective folder for setup.
